			<h1>The farming village of Goldhurst</h1>
			<p>The village of Goldhurst is a small collection of farms loosely connected to each other by by a small collection of buildings that has sprung up around the magnificent Cathedral apparently built out in the middle of nowhere. Has a decently-travelled road to Ashfall.</p>
			
			<h2>Places</h2>
			<p>A few of the more important businesses and buildings in the town.</p>
				<h3>All-Faiths Church</h3>
					<p>A large cathedral built to glorify religion in general, but not any particular angel or divine figure. The largest church on the western half of the island. The place to go for high-power clerical services that won't ask you to convert. Though, such services will not come cheap. Imadra Relvaunder is the current head priestess of the temple, a friendly human woman who worships a detity of sun and fertility. She is always happy to meet new people and helps out with anything and everything she can around the village.</p>
				<h3>Village Hall</h3>
					<p>The center of government in Goldhurst. Includes the office of Mayor Vurnor Leng, a human male.</p>
				<h3>General Store</h3>
					<p>The village's main source for supplies is the general store, owned and operated by Kerowyn Leng, a human woman. Not much to interest adventurers, but is the main place all the townsfolk sell what they make and buy what they need. Occasional shipment of supplies from Ashfall.</p>
				<h3>Ol' Boar Inn</h3>
					<p>A somewhat rundown, but clean and sturdy, inn that serves decent food and good drink. Has a few rooms visitors can rent for a few days at a time. Owner and barkeep is a human male known as Garon.</p>
			
			<h2>NPCs</h2>
			<p>Important NPCs in the town that PCs might want to interact with.</p>
				<h3>Vurnor and Kerowyn Leng</h3>
					<p>Brother and sister who are the town's mayor and owner of the local general store respectively. They are physically very different from the rest of the town. It is open knowledge that the two of them are originally from the Jade Lotus City-State, though nobody knows what series of events had them end up here. Both of them are friendly, but a bit uptight about proper manners and protocol.</p>
