			<h1>Here are some of the better known places on the island</h1>
			<h2><a href="echosong.html">Echo Song</a></h2>
				<p>Sort of the center of the campaign setting, though norwhere near the center of the island. This is the default start of any adventurer’s career. It is a small but prosperous mining town in the mountains in the south-western quarter of the island, about a third of the way across from the western coast. Mostly human with a few dragonborn and kitsune inhabitants. Has a somewhat traveled road to Ashfall. Protected by a bunch of thugs that live in a mansion a bit away from the main area of town.</p>
			<h2>Ashfall</h2>
				<p>Once a great port city on the western coast of the island. The second biggest city on the island, even now after it has fallen into hard times. About 50 years ago a nearby volcano erupted and covered the lands with ash. Including the city. The ash turned out to be imbued with elemental fire so it burns everything flammable it touches. Making cleanup quite difficult. So the city has become mostly abandoned with dunes and piles of ember-glowing ash covering most of the city streets. Even in it’s mostly abandoned state it is the most populated settlement on the island (that is known, anyway) and is a major nexus of trade not only with the rest of the world (what is left of it anyway) but other places on the island since sea travel is much safer and faster than going overland. This is where adventurers go if they need to visit a proper big city for supplies or knowledge not available in small villages.</p>
			<h2>Goldhurst</h2>
				<p>Small farming village a week or so travel north/northwest from Echo Song. There is a road from Goldhurst to Ashfall, so that is the more common route people take to get between the two. Not that there is a lot of travel. Goldhurst is near the border of what is considered dragonborn territory. Not that there are great numbers of dragonborn who live there, but there are a half-dozen will known dragonborn fortresses and ruins to the north that still stand. It is rumored that the dragonborn empire from a cycle or two ago had a significant presence on the island in that area. Goldhurst supplies the vast majority of food for both Ashfall and Echo Song.</p>
			<h2>Innsmouth Lighthouse</h2>
				<p>A large lighthouse that is on the west coast of the island halfway between Ashfall and Forgetown. It's light is a beacon of safety to the ships that travel to the rest of the world, as well as guiding less brave ship captains around the rocky coasts along the island itself.</p>
			<h2>The Steppes</h2>
				<p>Empty plains with few plants and even fewer animals. Only the occasional hunter-gatherer manages a living in this desolate waste. North of the desert and northeast of the dragonborn territories. Rumors of anicent evils abound to explain how it remains so empty, but most realize it's just the fact that nothing useful grows there. Even further north is the frozen end of the world that none return from.</p>
			<h2>Forgetown</h2>
				<p>A small village of blacksmiths that live on a river that quicky reaches the ocean. They  melt down weapons and armor to create new weapons and armor. The semi-religious smiths that tend a great magic furnace in the middle of town pay good money for broken weapons, armor, and other metal equipment. On the north-west quarter of the island, somewhere between the dragonborn territories and the empty steppes. Semi-regular ships travel from Ashfall and back.</p>
			<h2>Carrowmore</h2>
				<p>Small fishing village on the other side of the marshes and swamps from Echo Song. Not much traffic between Carrowmore and the rest of the island. Rumors of ancient powers upriver from them persist, but nobody who goes up there returns.</p>
			<h2>The Desert</h2>
				<p>The entire middle of the island is a huge desert. It was once a large inland ocean full of life. Then something happened to poison the water and the land around it. The salt sea has shrunk every year, leaving miles of lifeless desert behind. The sea continues to be the easiest way to get from one side of the island to the other without going the long way around, but the desert makes it a harder and harder trip each year.</p>
			<h2>The City of Tears</h2>
				<p>Once a major trade center, the City of Tears stands as a hollow ghost of it's former self. Built after the inland ocean became the salt sea, but before it had shrunk so much. The city is mostly empty but outside the gates lives a shanty town of caravan masters and bandits, a combination of looters of the city and the few people that manage to travel across the desert and ocean to connect the two sides of the island. The only water source is inside the city itself, which is the only reason anyone risks the dangers within.</p>
			<h2>The Shining Heavens School</h2>
				<p>A obscure martial arts dojo that teaches magical fighting styles. It is located somewhere in the near reaches of the desert. The precise location is known only to those that the school has accepted as students. Few leave the school until they attain mastery of the style, and even then most masters stay to teach others and meditate on the universe instead of traveling away from the dojo. Very much a 'no riches and no sex' sort of place.</p>
				<p>The school (both the place and the fighting style) has a well-deserved reputation for discipline, and is virtually obsessed with meditation. This martial art is known for the painful "Heavenly Battle Smite" and the mysterious "Bright Sky Kick".</p>
			<h2>Jade Lotus City-State</h2>
				<p>Located in the north-east part of the island. The largest and most populated city on the island. Isolationist not so much because they don't welcome outsiders, but because they have very strict protocols and manners that even outsiders are expected to obey. A very orderly and beucratic city where everything requires a license and what ranks and passes you have determines where in the city you are allowed.</p>
				<p>Ruled by elves, for the most part. Very magic-friendly (as long as it's the right type of magic and you have the right licenses of course) and known for their magic-fueled artifical body parts and golems. Very hard to get to, is right on the northern border of the Qelong territory and pretty much keeps the madness there from spilling out to the rest of the island. At least from the north. The ocean contains the Qelong madness to the east and south.</p>
			<h2>Hite-Qelong</h2>
				<p>Nobody really goes here. It isn't a settlement, but an entire area of magical corruption, warfare, and debris from when gods directly fought each other here on the mortal plane. There are rumors of magic to be found that are worth the extreme danger, but few who go there even make it all the way there, with even less surviving long enough to find the rumored magics. None in living memory have returned from that place.</p>
			<h2>Strange Chocolate Factory</h2>
				<p>A strange isolated factory that produces chocolates that are world-reknown. In better times it shipped find luxury chocolates to every known port in the world. Even now, after the outside world has crumbled yet again, ships still visit to fill their cargo holds with the chocolate to bring to the few remaining cities that remain. Plus the Jade Lotus City-State imports quite a bit of the chocolate.</p>
