			<h1>Houserules for D&D style Fate Accelerated</h1>
				<p>We are using Fate Accelerated as the basic ruleset for the campaign. With a few tweaks and additions to make it feel a bit more like proper Dungeons & Dragons.</p>
				
				<p>PCs have six stress boxes, each one worth one stress.</p>
				
			<h2>Classes</h2>
				<p>Classes will be handled with stunts. Each Dungeons & Dragons class will be a combination of two specific stunts. This is not to mean that these stunts can't be mixed and matched. Not to mention that a standard character starts with three stunts, so even a player wanting to go full 'Fighter' can pick up a stunt from another class or some individual stunt to help them better define the specific type of fighter they have in mind for their character.</p>
				<p>Of course, these should be as flexible and open to interpretation as any stunt. Perhaps a wizard takes the 'enemy specialization' stunt, but instead of killing it's studying different enemies? Every five enemy corpses (or living beings) studied in detail gives some kind of bonus.</p>
				
				<h3>Fighter:</h3>
					<p>Weapon Specialization - Someone with this stunt becomes more skilled with weapons as they use them. Every so many enemies killed with a specific type of weapon (sword, spear, long bow, etc) gives bonuses for using that weapon. Bonuses are situational, so mechanically this should encourage anyone with this stunt to carry around a diverse set of weapons to use whichever one has the best special ability in a situation.</p>
					<p>Enemy Specialization - Someone with this stunt learns how to best fight enemies with experience. Every so many of a specific enemy (kobolds, slimes, etc) grants special bonuses for fighting that enemy in the future.</p>
				<h3>Wizard:</h3>
					<p>Magic - This stunt allows the character to use magic. See the 'Magic' section for rules. Stunt has both a connected Approach and a source of magical power included.</p>
					<p>Spellcasting - Someone with the Spellcasting stunt can prepare a number of spells equal to the Approach they use magic with pluss the number of Mystic Mutations they have. Preparing a spell has two primary advantages. One, there is no limit to how many stress can be spent when casting a prepared spell. The other advantage is that preparing a spell charges the magic-user's body with magical energies letting them accomplishing small magical effects without spending stress. As well as drawing on the spell inside them for other things. Like preparing a fireball spell might allow the magic-user to see the world around them as heat and flammability instead of with light and sound. Cantrips and knowledge, basically.</p>
				<h3>Cleric:</h3>
					<p>Magic - This stunt allows the character to use magic. See the 'Magic' section for rules. Stunt has both a connected Approach and a source of magical power included.</p>
					<p>Miracles - Someone with this stunt can inflict mystic mutations on whoever they are using magic on instead of gaining one themselves. It also makes magic more powerful when used on targets with mystic mutations from the same faith as the person with this stunt.</p>
				<h3>Monk:</h3>
					<p>Magic - This stunt allows the character to use magic. See the 'Magic' section for rules. Stunt has both a connected Approach and a source of magical power included.</p>
					<p>Martial Arts - Someone with this stunt can create and use combo attacks of several connected combat moves right after each other. Each time the PC successfully uses a martial arts attack (come up with cool name like "Flying Tiger Punch") the PC can immediately attempt another martial arts attack. The maximum combo is three actions linked togther. A player should have a list of commonly used combos. They should be in quick succession, DM is perfectly justified in moving to the next person in combat if the monk player takes too long deciding the next part of the combo.</p>

			<h1>Magic Rules</h1>
				<p>The Magic stunt grants the PC the ability to spend stress boxes to add that amount of bonus to an action roll. The action should be something big and impressive, not just a normal non-magical event. Standard Stress or Magic Stress can be used to fuel magic. One point of stress spent equals +1 to roll. The maximum stress that can be spent is the rating of the connected Approach.</p>
				<p>Being able to use magic grants a separate stress track. Base magic stress is equal to the amount of mystic mutations the PC has. These stress boxes can only be used to fuel magic effects and spells. They reset at the end of a scene same as normal stress.</p>

				<h2>Mystic Mutations</h2>
				<p>The mortal form cannot channel magic safely. Anyone who uses any amount of magic is at risk of having their body & mind (& possibly soul) by the magic they use. The good news is that the more mutations a magic-user has, the more powerful magic they can channel. The bad news is that anyone with too many mystic mutations becomes a puppet of the magic with no free will and only wishes to further the goals of the magic that flows through them.</p>
				<p>Whenever a PC uses magic (spends stress for a magic effect or casts a spell) they have to check to see if they suffer mystic mutation. This is a d8 roll with modifiers based on amount of stress spent and number of mystic mutations the PC has. 1d8+(stress spent - mutations possessed) and if the result is 8 or higher, a new mutation is gained. </p>
				<h3>Mystic Mutations table</h3>
				<p>Specific mutation is determined by the DM. Roll 1d12 to see what gets affected. Details should be somewhat influenced by the source of the PCs power</p>
				<ol>
				<li>Head</li>
				<li>Eyes</li>
				<li>Arm</li>
				<li>Leg</li>
				<li>Torso</li>
				<li>Voice</li>
				<li>Aura</li>
				<li>Arm</li>
				<li>Leg</li>
				<li>Eyes</li>
				<li>Hair</li>
				<li>Skin</li>
				</ol>
			

				<h2>Magic Components</h2>
				<p>Exotic and magical materials that can be spent instead of stress to create magical effects. They are harvested from exotic flora and fauna. Most are expendable, only able to be used once. Rare exceptions can be reused over and over, permanently adding to the PCs magic stress track when worn/carried/bonded.</p>

			<h1>Stunts</h1>
				<p>Magic Scholar - This stunt allows a PC to study magic artifacts to learn how to duplicate their magical effect. It also allows the PC to research and create spells.</p>
