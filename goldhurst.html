			<h1>The farming village of Goldhurst</h1>
			<p>The village of Goldhurst is a small collection of farms loosely brought together by a small collection of buildings that has sprung up around the magnificent Cathedral apparently built out in the middle of nowhere. Has a well-travelled road to Ashfall.</p>
			
			<h2>Places</h2>
			<p>A few of the more important businesses and buildings in the town.</p>
				<h3>All-Faiths Church</h3>
					<p>A large cathedral built to glorify religion in general, but not any particular angel or divine figure. The largest church on the western half of the island. The place to go for high-power clerical services that won't ask you to convert. Though, such services will not come cheap.</p>
			
			<h2>NPCs</h2>
			<p>Important NPCs in the town that PCs might want to interact with.</p>
				<h3>Imadra Relvaunder </h3>
					<p>Human woman, head priestress of the church. Seems to worship some kind of sun and fertility divinity. She is friendly and always happy to help people out.</p>
				<h3>Lymmura Auldarhk </h3>
					<p>What some might call the second in command of the church. Far more martial than Imadra, though not technically a paladin. She is a member of the Dauntless Rose and often seeks brave souls to go defeat some evil on her behalf since she can't go gallavanting around herself and leave the cathedral (and town) undefended. Somewhat suspicious of outsiders until they prove themselves good people.</p>
