			<h1>Some of the monsters found in my campaign setting.</h1>
			<p>These are often just my own take on monsters other people have thought up. These are the monsters that would be common knowledge to any adventurer (for the most part) but are just different enough from what you might find elsewhere that I want there to be notes for players.</p>
			<p>Gnolls - Humanoid-ish hyena creatures that worship demons and eat anything living they can catch. Well, anything they catch that don't get sacrificed to the demons they worship. Psychotic cannibal satanists.</p>
			<p>Goblin Trees - Carnivorous trees that drop large fruit that unfold into waist-tall humanoid-ish monsters that attack to kill creatures to feed their tree. Each tree has 2d4 fruit at any time. A forest will have a scattering of goblin fruit wandering around hunting, and trees will drop half of their fruit if they detect (sound and vibration in the ground) anything moving nearby. If the tree is attacked directly it will drop all of its fruit to defend itself.</p>
