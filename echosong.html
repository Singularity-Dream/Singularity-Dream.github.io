			<h1>The mining town of Echo Song</h1>
			<p>A small town in one of the more easy to reach valleys of the mountains. It is where many miners live when not out prospecting or mining in their claims. Has roads to both Ashfell and Forgetown.</p>
			
			<h2>Places</h2>
			<p>A few of the more important businesses and buildings in the town.</p>
				<h3>Marble Bathhouse</h3>
					<p>A large bathhouse build out of shining white marble. Obviously built with the optimism that the town would grow much larger. It would not be out of place in a city as big as Ashfall. The anticipated growth of the small mining town never happened, but the bathhouse was built to last. The bathhouse is run by a small kitsune clan that is happy to serve and bathe anyone with coin to pay for their services. A good place to relax and get clean after serious work or adventuring. The kistune clan also provides some sewing services for elegant gowns and formal wear.</p>
			
			<h2>NPCs</h2>
			<p>Important NPCs in the town that PCs might want to interact with.</p>
				<h3>Halia Smokescale</h3>
					<p>Older dragonborn woman. Very curvy. Runs the Miner's Exchange that is more or less in charge of people's claims. Is mostly in charge of it because she can smell how rich the ore brought in for examination is. Ambitious and only a small secret that she wants to be running the entire town someday. The person adventurers want to talk to about appraising treasure or getting any kind of legitimacy for property claims in the mountain range.</p>
					<p>She's not very nice and wants to be left alone if there isn't business to be done. Very much not a morning person.</p>
				<h3>Kaylessa Irkell</h3>
					<p>Human woman who runs the local inn. The inn is called The Swinging Sword and is the main place for travelers and adventurers to rest. She's friendly and the place is pretty popular for the locals to gather around dinnertime, so it's a good place to get the latest gossip. Kaylessa pretty much hears everything worth hearing in town. Partly because she is a good cook and mostly because she's a beautiful redhead with the second biggest chest in town. The inn's rates are reasonable and the good is pretty good.</p>
				<h3>Eldras Tantur</h3>
					<p>The local blacksmith. A large dragonborn male with two sons and a daughter. Sons help out around the smithy, the daughter would like to help but is mostly kept out of sight because she's a very attractive teen female in a frontier town. Eldras and his children are skilled smiths who can make almost anything that requires no specialized alloys or treatments. They can temper swords and reinforce armor, and they often repair tools and weapons.</p>
					<p>The Tanturs are rarely seen away from their smithy. They work all day long every day filling endless orders for hasps, hinges, locks, and chains, plus hardware for wagons such as cotter pins, bolt rings, wheel rims, and wheel hubs. The main smithy is outside and Eldras can often be seen working at it. Inside the house is a smaller smithy that the sons and daughter work at. He is doing his best to keep his sons contained until they grow up and settle down a bit. While his daughter is kept inside to not tempt the boys and men in town too much</p>
				<h3>Haeleeya Hanadroma</h3>
					<p>The matriarch of the kitsune clan that runs the town bathhouse. Clever, business-minded, and friendly to anyone she thinks will be a good customer.</p>
