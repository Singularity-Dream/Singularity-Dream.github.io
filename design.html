			<h1>Here are some of the basic design principles I want to follow</h1>
			<p>Here are the basic design goals I have in mind. Just the basic foundational ideas I want to guide the creation and growth of the campaign setting.</p>

			<h2>In no particular order:</h2>

			<p>Magic corrupts.</p>

			<p>Adventurers are people who donâ€™t fit into normal society.</p>

			<p>Hunting fauna and flora for food and exotic ingredigents/parts should be a major facet of adventuring. It's the best way to gain improved equipment (fire lizard hide is good for fire-resistance leather armor) and craftsmen in villages/cities will pay good money for rare finds.</p>

			<p>Logstical play is one of the primary goals. Food, water, light. Keeping track of basic resources is important and the search for clean water and food should be part of any extended adventure.</p>

			<p>It is a sandbox setting that should react to the PCs decisions and actions. Game should not have a plot that the PCs have to react to. Just PC choices and the consequences of those choices coming back at them.</p>
