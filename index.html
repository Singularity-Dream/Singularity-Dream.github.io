			<h1>This is the basic overview of the campaign setting</h1>
			<p>There is an island near the edge of the world. Far across the largest ocean, only the biggest kingdoms and empires discover it. When they do it seems perfect for their most dangerous experiments and prisoners. A place to put dangerous things far away from their citizens.</p>

			<p>Which, in turn, means it is far enough to be safe when those same kingdoms and empires fall. Over and over the cycle continues until the island is covered in ruins and debris from a dozen different world-spanning empires that were once unparalleled in power and conquest. Now just memories and history recorded from the view of unhinged wizards, bitter criminals, and desperate political rebels.</p>

			<p>The latest collapse was only a few generations ago. Soon enough that there are still parts of the world out there clinging to life, able to trade with by the occasional merchant vessel that manages the long trip between the island and the rest of the world. As well as the occasional ship of refugees from those places that didn't manage to cling to stability.</p>

			<p>The island is a mostly unknown stretch of land. Deserts, forests, plains, frozen steppes, swamps and jungles. Littered with the ruins of who knows what civilizations had come over the thousands of years of the world's history. With small villages here and there where people have gotten together for protection and comfort against the dangers (magical and natural) that can be found everywhere.</p>

			<hr />

			<p>The Last Island is a tabletop RPG campaign setting for Dungeons &amp; Dragons style adventures in a post-post-apocalyptic fantasy setting. The apocalypse has come and gone, devastating the rest of the world but this island was mostly untouched and has seen dozens of world-destroying events pass it by. This island is where the remains of a dozen powerful civilizations all mix together. Not the best of those civilizations, but the worst and the weirdest.</p>

			<p>Survival is hard, but not impossible. Magic is useful, but dangerous and corrupts.  Trust nothing outside of the walls of your village, but your very survival and prosperity depends on what hunters and adventurers bring back from the wilderness.</p>
