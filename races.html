			<h1>The most common races for PC characters</h1>
			<h3>Human</h3>
				<p>The standard human. They aren't particular special. They can breed with anything and die like flies. Everyone (who isn't human) agrees they are kind of dumb & flimsy, but you always seem to miss a couple when trying to wipe them out and they infest the place all over again anyway. Besides, their suspectibility to magic and stuff means they are just so useful as raw materials. Though their short life spans means a population can become resistant or immune to things in just a few centuries.</p>
			<h3>Elves</h3>
				<p>Transhuman alchemists seeking perfection. They use magic and alchemy to make themselves better. Immortality, better physical/mental/magical abilities, etc, etc. They aim to be perfect in every way. However they are pretty easy-going about it given that they are ageless and immune to just about all natural diseases. They don't have kids naturally. Instend they create their kids in alchemy laboratories using a mixture of genetic material from themselves and one or more partners. It's a careful process that most elves use to test magic and alchemy enhancements on someone else before applying such things to themselves. Because of this, elves are pretty dang rare. Basically human in build, if somewhat idealized in form.</p>
			<h3>Dragonborn</h3>
				<p>A mixture of dragon magic and human mortal flesh. They have a variety of appearances from almost human with some scales to hunched over barely bipedal dragon creature. Somewhat bigger than humans as a general rule.</p>
			<h3>Kitsune</h3>
				<p>Small'n'busty foxgirl tricksters. About three feet tall on average. Females are absurdly curvy. Men look like flat-chested girls. Both genders tend to dress in japanese-style feminine outfits. Human looking except for fox ears on the top of their head and one or more fluffy fox tails behind them.</p>
			<h3>Forge-born</h3>
				<p>The forge-born are sapient golems that average eight feet plus in height. The more beautiful are made from ivory and gold, or obsidian and silver. Plain ones might be made from steel and granite. They are very strong and suffer few of the weaknesses of the living races. Even though they are not biologically equipped for sex in the traditional sense, they can feel pleasure and do desire companionship.</p>
